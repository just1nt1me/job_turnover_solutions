# Employee Turnover Rate Prediction
Employee Turnover is an issue for many companies. The recruitment process is costly, so it would be worthwhile to know if an employee is likely to resign.
Let's use data analysis and machine learning to predict whether an employee is likely to resign, and look for what factors influence their decision.

## Dataset
Features of the dataset includes relative information about the employees.

## classification_notebook
This contains the initial analysis of the simpler dataset "8WS1_ver1", and several attempts to build a predictive model that can consistently classify employees at risk of resigning.

## job_turnover_analysis_model2
This notebook contains a deeper analysis of the second dataset "8WS1_ver2" which contains more features for each employee.
After thorough data cleaning and feature engineering, a simple logistic regression model was constructed.
Further analysis shed light on which features were most significant in determining whether an employee is likely to resign or not.
